## SMARTER TAB-COMPLETION (Readline bindings) ##

# Perform file completion in a case insensitive fashion
set completion-ignore-case on

# Treat hyphens and underscores as equivalent
set completion-map-case on

# Display matches for ambiguous patterns at first tab press
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on


# Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off


# If set to 'on', when listing completions, Readline displays the common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color. The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable. The default is 'off'.
set colored-completion-prefix on

# If set to 'on', Readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type. The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable. The default is 'off'.
set colored-stats on


# Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through
# commands (basically more intelligent Up/Down behavior)
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward


# Alt/Metan + Left/Right arrow keys to move the cursor wordwise
"\e[3;3~": forward-word
"\e[3;3~": backward-word

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off


# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off

# Use Alt/Meta + Delete to delete the preceding word
"\e[3;3~": kill-word
