# The above command:
#   for all known branches,
#   (force coloring on this, especially since it's being piped)
#   optionally, specify the number of branches you want to display
#   sort descending by last commit
#   show local branches (change to "" to include both local + remote branches)
#   apply the formatting template above
#   break into columns
#   use the pager only if there's not enough space
