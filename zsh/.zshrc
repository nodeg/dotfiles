# Personal Zsh configuration file. It is strongly recommended to keep all

# variables such as PATH) in this file or in files source by it.

# Periodic auto-update on Zsh startup: 'ask' or 'no'.
# You can manually run `z4h update` to update everything.
zstyle ':z4h:' auto-update      'no'
# Ask whether to auto-update this often; has no effect if auto-update is 'no'.
zstyle ':z4h:' auto-update-days '28'

# Automaticaly wrap TTY with a transparent tmux ('integrated'), or start a
# full-fledged tmux ('system'), or disable features that require tmux ('no').
zstyle ':z4h:' start-tmux       'no'
# Move prompt to the bottom when zsh starts up so that it's always in the
# same position. Has no effect if start-tmux is 'no'.
zstyle ':z4h:' prompt-at-bottom 'yes'

# Keyboard type: 'mac' or 'pc'.
zstyle ':z4h:bindkey' keyboard  'pc'

# Right-arrow key accepts one character ('partial-accept') from
# command autosuggestions or the whole thing ('accept')?
zstyle ':z4h:autosuggestions' forward-char 'accept'

# Recursively traverse directories when TAB-completing files.
zstyle ':z4h:fzf-complete' recurse-dirs 'yes'

# Enable ('yes') or disable ('no') automatic teleportation of z4h over
# ssh when connecting to these hosts.
zstyle ':z4h:ssh:example-hostname1'   enable 'yes'
zstyle ':z4h:ssh:*.example-hostname2' enable 'no'
# The default value if none of the overrides above match the hostname.
#zstyle  ':z4h:ssh:*'                  ssh-command kitty +kitten ssh

# Clone additional Git repositories from GitHub.

# This doesn't do anything apart from cloning the repository and keeping it
# up-to-date. Cloned files can be used after `z4h init`. This is just an
# example. If you don't plan to use Oh My Zsh, delete this line.

# Install or update core components (fzf, zsh-autosuggestions, etc.) and
# initialize Zsh. After this point console I/O is unavailable until Zsh
# is fully initialized. Everything that requires user interaction or can
# perform network I/O must be done above. Everything else is best done below.
